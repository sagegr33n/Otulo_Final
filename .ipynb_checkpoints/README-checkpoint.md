# How Primary Productivity Distribution Affects the Migration of Arctic Terns


**Sage Otulo**   

OCEAN 215 Final Project  
Autumn 2024


 
My project seeks to establish a connection between monthly distribution of chlorophyll as an indicator for primary productivity and shifts in the migration routes of Arctic Terns, seabirds known for making the world's longest migration annually. I worked to establish this by working with and analyzing data collected globally that recorded monthly chlorophyll concentration and Arctic Tern geolocation data during peak migration season in 2008 and 2009. In doing this, I was able to successfuly establish a correlation in the annual path of Arctic Terns flying over the coast of Western Africa and higher chlorophyll concentrations located in the same regions.
